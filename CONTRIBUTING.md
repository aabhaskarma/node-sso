# Welcome to Node SSO contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

## New contributor guide

Before submitting any new SSO service please visit one of the already exists SSO service/contracts because we want to make function uniform on all services.

## Good first issue

We are plaining to remove axios from our project. We appreciate if you can add small GET and POST function service similar to axios using native nodejs module.

Feel free to ping me on aabhaskarma@gmail.com
